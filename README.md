# ResNet50 Feature Visualization with t-SNE
In this work, we take the case of ResNet-50 on CIFAR-10 as an example. Moreover, based on this repository, one can perform t-SNE visualizations across different DNN architectures and datasets to further analyze the feature representations.


Extract features from pre-trained ResNet50 and visualize using t-SNE dimensionality reduction.

## Features
- Feature extraction from ResNet50
- t-SNE visualization
- Support for CIFAR-10 dataset
- Customizable parameters

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resnet50-tsne-visualization.git
